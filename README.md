# Project Title
LIRI Bot

# How does LIRI Bot works?

LIRI Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# Instructions:

You can use the following commands:

concert-this [artist/band name here] - Gives you information about concerts
spotify-this-song [song name] - Gives you information about song name
movie-this [movie name] - Gives you information about that movie
do-what-it-says - Reads from random.txt and gets the command and the value and executes the command
